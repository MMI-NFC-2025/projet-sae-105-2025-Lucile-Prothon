        <p class="intro">At first glance, this word may raise questions: What is this disorder often called <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Autism Spectrum
                Disorder (ASD)</a>? What is its origin and how has research on it developed? Understanding its history
            and the studies surrounding it is essential to better grasp the reality of those affected.</p>

            proper diagnosis.</p>

        <h3>Eugen Bleuler and the Origins of the Term "Autism"</h3>
        <p>To understand this disorder, it is important to go back to the earliest research. The term <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">"autism"</a> was
            first defined in 1911.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">“The term <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">"autism"</a> was first defined in 1911 by <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Eugen Bleuler</a>, who used it to describe a particular
            attitude observed in young adults with schizophrenia.”</p>
        <p>Before tracing its history, it is helpful to clarify its current definition. According to the World Health
            Organization (WHO), it is a neurological disorder affecting brain development. There are several types of <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a>, hence
            the name “spectrum disorder”. Due to its complexity and variations, this disability can be difficult to
            detect, especially in children. Some people show similarities to <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> without a confirmed diagnosis being possible.
        </p>
        <p>In 1911, researcher <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Eugen Bleuler</a> used the term <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">"autism"</a> for the first time in his book Dementia
            praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenien (Early Dementia or the Group of Schizophrenias). He used it to
            describe a distinctive attitude observed in young adults with schizophrenia. At that time, it served to
            isolate and designate a particular attitude in schizophrenic young adults. But why this usage? We will
            explore that shortly. According to Bleuler, <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> was close to what he called “auto-erotism”,
            an outdated term referring to withdrawal into oneself. This term had been defined by another researcher in
            1905 in his book Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie (Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality). Bleuler
            explained that he wanted to distance himself from Freud’s reference to an expanded concept of sexuality that
            “could lead to many misunderstandings”. Another term was also created at that time: schizophrenia, used in
            the plural as it referred to a “group of schizophrenias”, aiming to evolve the concept previously used for
            early dementia.</p>
        <p>By 1911, the notion of <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">autism</a> had evolved significantly, leading to the need to clearly identify the
            childhood disorder. Swiss psychiatrist <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Adolf Meyer</a>, future director of <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Leo Kanner</a>, proposed an interpretation linked to
            psychic mechanics, mentioning a “destruction of naïveté”.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">We can note the evolution between Bleuler and Meyer; with the latter, the disorder
            comes closer to what we know today.</p>
        <p><a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Autism</a> is
            increasingly seen as a psychological disorder, although it was only recognised much later as such and as a
            genuine disability.</p>

        <h3>Towards an Understanding of Autism in Children</h3>
        <p>But the history of autism research does not stop there: let us jump forward a few years to discover what
            comes next. In 1923, the focus was on a loss of contact with reality. Researcher Eugène Minkowski, former
            assistant to Bleuler (who coined the term), echoed this in his book La Schizophrénie. It is worth noting
            that the disorder was initially seen as an offshoot of schizophrenia; although the two are now separate,
            they were not at the beginning of research.</p>
        <p>In 1930, a woman advanced the question of what <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> is. <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Melanie Klein</a> spoke of childhood schizophrenia to
            describe children who, in her view, lacked affective contact. She was the first to publish two descriptions
            of what might characterise this disorder.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">For now, everything is still somewhat vague and lacks a true description beyond
            conceptual ideas as seen previously.</p>
        <p>This conception would later be identified as Kanner’s autism. Lauretta Bender proposed a separation between
            childhood schizophrenia and <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">autism</a>. She explained that the biological process is broadly the same but does
            not have the same effect on a mature brain as on an immature one. In doing so, she absolved mothers, who
            until then had been held responsible for the disorder, stating that the family environment was not decisive.
            We can see this notion of maternal responsibility in the series Astrid et Raphaëlle (released 19 April
            2019), in season 1 episode 7 “La mort et compagnie”, where Mathild Nielsen confesses to Raphaëlle the reason
            for leaving her autistic daughter Astrid.</p>
        <p>Even before Kanner and Asperger, Dutch psychologist <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Ide Freye</a> had already mentioned the term “autism” as
            early as 1937 while studying children with severe developmental disorders alongside psychologist Chorus. She
            proposed a classification of psychological disorders in children that included <a href="glossary.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a>. This advance was
            significant, as a combination of orthopedagogy and psychotherapy was already being suggested at the time.

        <h3>Kanner and Early Infantile Autism</h3>
        <img class="img_article" src="/assets/img/autisme-infantile.avif" alt="Transition image for the article.">
        <p>We are now in 1943. Psychiatrist <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Leo Kanner</a> defined a clinical picture of an “autistic disturbance of affective
            contact”. It was first used as an adjective describing an “autistic disturbance of affective contact”, later
            called <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">"early
                infantile autism"</a>. This is where we see a difference between Bleuler’s initial 1905 definition and
            Kanner’s. For Bleuler, <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">autism</a> was a symptom of schizophrenia, whereas Kanner viewed it as a distinct
            disorder. This marked the clear separation between schizophrenia and <a href="glossary.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a>. To support his idea, Kanner
            studied 11 children, including Donald Triplett, followed for 5 years and designated as case no. 1. During
            his study, Kanner noted that all these children shared specific common traits:<br />
            - Difficulty establishing affective contact (emotional relationships).<br />
            - Intense interest in repetitive activities.<br />
            - Need for routines.<br />
            - Strong intellectual abilities in certain areas.</p>
        <p>From this observation came the conclusion that it was not a psychosis but a distinct developmental disorder.
            Meanwhile, on 8 October 1943 in Vienna, Austria, Austrian physician Hans Asperger studied four children he
            called his “little professors”. These observations were made under the Nazi regime with which he
            collaborated. The observations were written in German and first translated into English in 1971. It was in
            1981 that these writings truly gained recognition, thanks to <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Lorna Wing</a>, who based her research on them. These
            works became known as Asperger’s syndrome. Note that Asperger’s syndrome and Kanner’s syndrome are no longer
            used today, partly due to advances in research and partly because of Asperger’s collaboration with the Nazis
            and the treatment his “little professors” received.</p>

            alt="Portrait of Leo Kanner, American psychiatrist of Austrian origin.">
        <p class="legende">Leo Kanner</p>

        <h3>The Birth of the Autism Spectrum</h3>
        <p>However, by 1990, differences were observed: some autistic people manage to live independently, have social
            lives, and even pursue studies or work. This observation led to distinguishing several aspects of <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a>,
            separating “severe” autism from what was termed <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">“high-functioning autism”</a>. One might then ask: how
            do we determine if someone is affected by <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">autism</a>? From this point, we began to speak of an autism spectrum—a single
            large family of disorders that manifest to varying degrees, as there are many different forms. Autistic
            people can experience very diverse situations:<br />
            - Some require constant support, while others are more independent.<br />
            - Some have mild social difficulties, others more significant ones.<br />
            - Abilities and interests also vary greatly from person to person.</p>
        <p>In addition to differences in social interaction or communication, some autistic people develop what are
            known as special interests. These intense passions for a particular subject—such as animals, music, or
            numbers—can play a major role in their lives.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">These highly focused interests are often a source of joy, calm, and motivation,
            and can even become an asset in their educational or professional journey.</p>
        <p>For example, in the series Astrid et Raphaëlle mentioned earlier, one of the protagonists with <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> has a
            special interest in puzzles. Another character, William, is passionate about trains. In Astrid’s case, this
            interest drives her to participate in investigations, as shown in the series aired on France TV.</p>
        <p>This diversity led to the concept of <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</a>, a term that gradually became widespread.
            Finally, in 2010, autism was linked to a neurological disorder in the early stages of brain development. In
            particular, a defect in nerve cells at the level of <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">synapses</a> was identified. This defect may be
            hereditary and linked to certain combinations of common genetic factors. This supports the idea that <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> can be
            genetically transmitted.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">Today, research continues to evolve, as the autism spectrum encompasses highly
            varied and sometimes still poorly understood forms.</p>
        <p>Some people still cannot know with certainty whether they are affected. Furthermore, several concepts are now
            debated, including the term <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">“high-functioning autism”</a>, which does not always reflect the real daily
            challenges these individuals face. In the next article, we will explore how the work of researchers like <a
                href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">Lorna Wing</a>
            helped rethink <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">autism</a> through the concept of a spectrum.</p>
