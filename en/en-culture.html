            <h1>Autism in Culture and Media</h1>
        </section>

        <h2>How the Media Represents Autism</h2>
        <p class="lecture">Reading time: 4 to 5 minutes</p>
        <p class="intro">How are autistic people perceived, and how were they perceived in culture? Why does difference
            still cause so many misunderstandings? The media, whose main role is to influence the viewer, often tailor
            their content to the dominant ideas and values of their time. Thus, throughout history, the representation
            of autism in culture and media has evolved significantly, reflecting the mindsets and prejudices of each
            era.</p>

        <h3>Often Stereotypical Representation</h3>
        <p>You probably picture a gifted individual who prefers to be alone, or think the disorder comes from
            upbringing? But why is this image so entrenched? In the 1990s and 2000s, it was widely promoted, especially
            with the release of the film Rain Man in 1988. Dustin Hoffman plays a savant character with extraordinary
            calculation abilities but emotionally detached from the world.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">The film grossed $239.97 million internationally.</p>
        <p>It therefore had a huge impact but also distorted the perception of autism at the time. Indeed, it trapped
            those affected in <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">stereotypes</a>, preventing visibility of the real, multifaceted nature of autism.
            Years before the film’s release, in 1976, <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Lorna Wing</a> redefined <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a> as a spectrum called Autism Spectrum Disorder
            (ASD). At that time, people on the spectrum were often portrayed as white men with high intellect, rendering
            women, racialized individuals, and non-verbal people invisible.</p>

        <img class="img_article" src="/assets/img/rainman.avif" alt="Actor from the film Rain Man.">
        <p class="legende">Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man</p>

        <h3>An Evolution</h3>
        <p>The emergence of the “neurodiversity” concept in the 1990s profoundly changed the perception of autism.
            Rather than viewing autism as a defect to correct, this movement promotes recognition of the diversity of
            neurological functioning. It has inspired newer, more human and respectful representations, highlighting the
            skills, creativity, and sensitivity of autistic people.</p>
        <p>In recent years, we can observe an evolution in the representation of these individuals in the media. On
            Netflix, for example, many films and series address the topic by valuing their unique traits and strengths.
            <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">The Good Doctor</a>
            (2018) features a doctor on the spectrum overcoming social difficulties while showcasing his talent. In
            2022, South Korea released <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>, portraying a woman with autism in a respectful and
            sensitive way. This type of content remains rare.</p>
        <p>At the same time, various documentaries, particularly on France TV or Arte, present portraits or scientific
            testimonies, enriching public understanding. This shift can also be seen in modern productions like Atypical
            (2017), which follows the daily life of an autistic teenager seeking independence and self-understanding.
            Unlike older representations, the series shows everyday life, relationships, mistakes, tenderness, and
            humor. The 2023 German film Afire (Roter Himmel) is another excellent example of evolving attitudes. Autism
            is no longer seen by many as something negative, but rather as a source of inspiration.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">Director Christian Petzold even revealed that he drew inspiration from autistic
            behaviors to add nuance to his main character.</p>

        <h3>A Media Revolution</h3>
        <p>With the rise of social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, the image of autism is now
            partly shaped by those who live it daily. Through personal testimonies and advocacy, creators such as Hugo
            Horiot, Alexandra Duvivier, and Yo Samdy Sam share their experiences and struggles. This personal expression
            offers a more authentic view, free from scripted portrayals in television or films.</p>
        <p>The hashtag <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">#ActuallyAutistic</a> has been used in nearly 6,515,470 posts on X (formerly
            Twitter), many from autistic people with or without an official diagnosis.</p>
        <p class="texte_mit_en_avant">This movement has helped amplify their voices, allowing people to express
            themselves freely away from <a href="glossary.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                class="lien-souligne">stereotypes</a> and labels imposed by the media.</p>
        <p>Today, these new representations contribute to a better understanding of <a href="glossary.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="lien-souligne">autism</a>, although much progress
            remains to be made. The media still tend to highlight certain profiles—often male and high-potential—while
            neglecting more ordinary realities and daily challenges. The growing plurality of voices, especially through
            social networks, plays a crucial role in continuing to dismantle clichés and normalize difference.</p>
